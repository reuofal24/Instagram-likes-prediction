# Instagram-likes-prediction
## Machine Learning Project - Data Analysis
### In a small machine learning project using Python in Google Colab, we worked on a project titled "Instagram Likes Prediction." The goal of this project was to predict the number of likes a post would receive on Instagram. To achieve this, we followed several key steps including data exploration, modeling with linear regression, and evaluation.

### Began with data exploration, where we loaded the dataset and examined it to understand its structure and content. This included handling missing values, visualizing distributions, and identifying potential features that could influence the number of likes. 

### Next, moved on to modeling using linear regression. We used Python's libraries to build and train the model on our dataset. Linear regression helped us establish a relationship between the features and the target variable, which is the number of likes. We split the data into training and testing sets to ensure the model's accuracy.

### Finally, evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2) score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics provided insights into how well the model predicted the number of likes. 

### The project included a code file that documented all steps and evaluations, making it easy for others to understand and replicate the analysis.
